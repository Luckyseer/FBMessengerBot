#FBMessengerBot-v2
Current Version: `Alpha v0.3`

A facebook messenger chatbot made in python that is an improved version of an old chatbot that I made.

This was initially made for me and my friends to play DnD games via messenger chat. I just added a few random features for fun.
#Dependencies:
Fbchat

Python 3.x(Tested with Python 3.7)
#How to use:
Enter email and password into the `config.ini` file and run main.py.
You can find the commands for the bot in `bot_class.py`

It still does not have all the old commands from the previous version but the new commands are still cleaner and
better documented.


**Warning: Be careful when using this as this does not use a facebook offical API. There is a chance that your account may get banned. I am not responsible if that happens.**
